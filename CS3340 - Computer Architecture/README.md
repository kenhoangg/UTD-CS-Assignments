# CS3340 - Computer Architecture
## Course Description
This course introduces the concepts of computer architecture by going through multiple levels of abstraction, and the numbering systems and their basic computations. It focuses on the instruction-set architecture of the MIPS machine, including MIPS assembly programming, translation between MIPS and C, and between MIPS and machine code. General topics include performance calculation, processor datapath, pipelining, and memory hierarchy.

## Homework
Assignments included deal with basic assembly language operations taught in lecture.

## Final Project
The final group project was to write a MIPS assembly program version of the Android game Lexathon. We as a team had a lot of challenges programming this project. A problem we had to overcome was the synchronizing of the code. There was a challenge finding the correct order of where the files and code had to sync. We also faced many challenges individually, such as getting the border to print correctly, the time counter and the overall flow of the game. I wrote the printing and shuffling of the Lexathon grid.

Project description: This Lexathon game is an adaptation of the Android word game Lexathon. The goal of the game is to find as many words as possible given the letters that are provided in the 3x3 grid. The user will have 60 seconds at the start of the game, and they will be given an additional 10 seconds for every correct word they find.
