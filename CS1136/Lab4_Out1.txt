1. Condition 1 was true because the variable b has the value 3, and the if statement is checking whether b + 2 is greater than or equal to the variable d, 
which contains the value 5. Because 3 + 2 does equal 5, b + 2 is greater than or equal to d.

2. Condition 2 was false because although d does contain a value of 5, the relational statement is comparing d, which contains the integer value 5, to
'5', which is the character 5. Since 5 does not equal '5', the program prints out false.

3. Condition 3 was true because c contains the value 4 which is less than d which contains the value 5, so condition 3 returns true.

4. Condition 4 was false because the statement "d = 4" returns the value 4 along with assigning 4 to d. The if statement reads all values that are not 0
as true, so not true is false, thus condition 4 returns false.
