# UTD-CS-Assignments
In this repository I have included most of the assignments and projects I have written during my time at the University of Texas at Dallas, while studying for a Computer Science degree. 

The projects are separated by class name using the class codes at UTD e.g. CS4485.

Disclaimer: Some of these projects may have missing files or may be versions of projects that do not work properly. These are just proof of projects I have done while at UTD.
